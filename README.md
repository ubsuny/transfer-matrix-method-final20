# The Transfer Matrix Method in Linear Dielectrics

This is the repository of the Transfer Matrix Method project for PHY 505. There is no installation required, simply clone the repository or download it as a zip file, and open it in an active directory. 

All necessary materials are located in the "Transfer Matrix Method Files" folder, which is further divided into three subfolders. An explanation of the physics behind the TMM as well the Python code itself can be found in the "Final Writeup" subfolder, while the code itself is located in the "Python Files" subfolder. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook contains trial computations concerning multi-layer anti-reflection coatings as well as a Distributed Bragg Reflector.
